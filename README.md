# private events

Based on https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations

## TODO
- [x] Modify your Userâ€™s Show page to list all the events a user has created.
- [x] Create an attend button on event#show
- [ ] Create an unattend button on event#show
- [ ] Restrict access to the buttons if event is over
- [ ] In users profile page, split past events into another card

- [ ] Another thing - add another validation to attend event/unattend, to restrict ability to current_user (prevent other users from making current user attend/unattend)
